Solar energy is one of the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy sources available. Unlike fossil fuels, solar power does not release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when generating electricity. Solar panels, typically installed on rooftops or in large solar farms, capture sunlight and convert it into usable energy through photovoltaic cells. While the initial installation cost can be high, prices have dropped significantly over the past decade, making solar energy more accessible to homeowners and businesses. Additionally, many governments offer tax incentives to encourage the adoption of solar technology as part of broader efforts to combat climate change.
